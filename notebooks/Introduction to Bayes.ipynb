    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Specify a probability model\n",
    "\n",
    "As was noted above, Bayesian statistics involves using probability models to solve problems. So, the first task is to *completely specify* the model in terms of probability distributions. This includes everything: unknown parameters, data, covariates, missing data, predictions. All must be assigned some probability density.\n",

    "\n",
    "This posterior distribution is formulated as a function of the probability model that was specified in Step 1. Usually, we can write it down but we cannot calculate it analytically. In fact, the difficulty inherent in calculating the posterior distribution for most models of interest is perhaps the major contributing factor for the lack of widespread adoption of Bayesian methods for data analysis. Various strategies for doing so comprise this tutorial.\n",

After all, it is not always easy to specify a full probabilistic model, nor to obtain output from the model once it is specified. So, why bother?\n",
    "\n",
    "> ... the Bayesian approach is attractive because it is useful. Its usefulness derives in large measure from its simplicity. Its simplicity allows the investigation of far more complex models than can be handled by the tools in the classical toolbox.  \n",
    "*-- Link and Barker 2010*\n",
    "\n",
    "We already noted that there is just one estimator in Bayesian inference, which lends to its ***simplicity***. Moreover, Bayes affords a conceptually simple way of coping with multiple parameters; the use of probabilistic models allows very complex models to be assembled in a modular fashion, by factoring a large joint model into the product of several conditional probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayesian statistics is also attractive for its ***coherence***. All unknown quantities for a particular problem are treated as random variables, to be estimated in the same way. Existing knowledge is given precise mathematical expression, allowing it to be integrated with information from the study dataset, and there is formal mechanism for incorporating new information into an existing analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, Bayesian statistics confers an advantage in the ***iterpretability*** of analytic outputs. Because models are expressed probabilistically, results can be interpreted probabilistically. Probabilities are easy for users (particularly non-technical users) to understand and apply."

Most scientists were introduced to the confidence interval during their introductory statistics course(s) in college. Yet, a large number of users mis-interpret the confidence interval.\n",

    "Here is the mathematical definition of a 95% confidence interval for some unknown scalar quantity that we will here call \\\\(\\theta\\\\):\n",

    "\n",
    "Recall that for frequentists, unknown parameters are **fixed**, which means there is no probability associated with them being any value except what they are fixed to. Here, the interval itself, and not \\\\(\\theta\\\\) is the random variable. The actual interval calculated from the data is just one possible realization of a random process, and it must be strictly interpreted only in relation to an infinite sequence of identical trials that might be (but never are) conducted in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "A valid interpretation of the above would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "> If the experiment were repeated an infinite number of times, 95% of the calculated intervals would contain \\\\(\\theta\\\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is what the statistical notion of \"confidence\" entails, and this sets it apart from probability intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since they regard unknown parameters as random variables, Bayesians can and do use probability intervals to describe what is known about the value of an unknown quantity. These intervals are commonly known as ***credible intervals***.\n",

    "The definition of a 95% credible interval is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\\\[Pr(a(y) < \\theta < b(y) | Y=y) = 0.95\\\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that we condition here on the data \\\\(y\\\\) instead of the unknown \\\\(\\theta\\\\). Thus, the endpoints are fixed and the variable is random. \n",
    "\n",
    "We are allowed to interpret this interval as:\n",
    "\n",
    "> There is a 95% chance \\\\(\\theta\\\\) is between \\\\(a\\\\) and \\\\(b\\\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, the credible interval is a statement of what we know about the value of \\\\(\\theta\\\\) based on the observed data."
