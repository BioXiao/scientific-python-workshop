    "______\n",
    "\n",
    "PyMC is a python module that implements Bayesian statistical models and\n",
    "fitting algorithms, including Markov chain Monte Carlo. Its flexibility\n",
    "and extensibility make it applicable to a large suite of problems. Along\n",
    "with core sampling functionality, PyMC includes methods for summarizing\n",
    "output, plotting, goodness-of-fit and convergence diagnostics.\n",
    "\n",
    "PyMC provides functionalities to make Bayesian analysis as painless as\n",
    "possible. Here is a short list of some of its features:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Fits Bayesian statistical models with Markov chain Monte Carlo and\n",
    "    other algorithms.\n",
    "-   Includes a large suite of well-documented statistical distributions.\n",
    "-   Uses NumPy for numerics wherever possible.\n",
    "-   Includes a module for modeling Gaussian processes.\n",
    "-   Sampling loops can be paused and tuned manually, or saved and\n",
    "    restarted later.\n",
    "-   Creates summaries including tables and plots.\n",
    "-   Traces can be saved to the disk as plain text, Python pickles,\n",
    "    SQLite or MySQL database, or hdf5 archives.\n",
    "-   Several convergence diagnostics are available.\n",
    "-   Extensible: easily incorporates custom step methods and unusual\n",
    "    probability distributions.\n",
    "-   MCMC loops can be embedded in larger programs, and results can be\n",
    "    analyzed with the full power of Python."

    "assume that the associated data are complete. That is, there are no\n",
    "missing values corresponding to any observations in the dataset.\n",
    "However, many real-world datasets have missing observations, usually due\n",
    "to some logistical problem during the data collection process. The\n",
    "easiest way of dealing with observations that contain missing values is\n",
    "simply to exclude them from the analysis. However, this results in loss\n",
    "of information if an excluded observation contains valid values for\n",
    "other quantities, and can bias results. An alternative is to impute the\n",
    "missing values, based on information in the rest of the model.\n",
